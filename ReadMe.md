# Train Ticket Booking System (Python)

A simple Python-based Train Ticket Booking System. This system allows users to book tickets for available train routes, view available trains, and manage their bookings. It simulates the functionalities of a real-world train booking system with basic features like seat reservation, displaying available trains, and canceling bookings.

## Features

- View available trains with their details (train number, source, destination, departure time, etc.)
- Book tickets for selected trains.
- Cancel booked tickets.
- Display all bookings for a user.
- Manage seat availability.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x or above
- Basic knowledge of Python and Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

# After cloning and installing dependencies, run the main.py script to start the system:
python main.py
